# DTR ToDo Box Pivot. 12/23/2017. 

#### Patrick McLaughlin & Matt Walker.

#### Expectations 
- Maintain the original code as much as possible, while increasing code readibility, functionality and style. 

- Both of want use jQuery as much as possible for ease. So refactor to jQuery. 

- Try to get to Time Zone level so we can try a third party JS library that isn't jQuery. 

#### Team Strengths

- Javascript/jQuery. CSS. 

#### Overcome obsticles

- Communication is key.  
- Using Slack, Waffle and using GitHub effectively. This will be the first project for both of us where remote work will need to be done.

#### Schedule Expectations

- Both available to work on Saturday/Sunday. M-W of next week we will work remotely and communicate via Slack/Git/Waffle, etc. 

#### Communications. See Above

#### Abilities Expectations

- Both feel good about writing our own Javascript and jQuery, but would like to work around an existing code base and refactor accordingly. 

#### Workload Expectations

- Initial refactor for phase 1 we do together using ping pong or driver-navigator so we are on the same page with what needs to be done. Once we both know the plan, we can divide and conqure Phase 2 and beyond. 

#### Workflow Expectations

- See Above, Obsticles/Exepectations. 

#### Giving and receiving feedback

- In person, and more communication via Slack/Github/Waffle. 

#### Agenda to Discuss Project.

- Discuss initial scheduling today 12/22, and start very basic refactor. Then start fresh on full refactor on Saturday 12/23.

- Phase 3
  - How do we style/hide completed To Dos. 
  - Importance refactor under 8 lines will be difficult
  - Use different lengths for fetching certain numbers of ideas on load
  - Refactor local Storage into a single function
